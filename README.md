# Raumreservierung v2.1
<b>After implementing the teacher-view to the project, it's now time to test all of its functionality.<br>
Everything done from now will be some fixes and improvements, no big changes are planned for the project from now on.</b>

## Help &amp; Support
If anyone reading this is interested in this project or is willing to help with its development, feel free to clone this repository and (stress-)test its functionalities by yourself.<br>
If someone needs an example database for doing so, feel free to contact me.

## Demo
A demo-version of this project in its current state (v2.1) is available at [gykl-rr.lima.zone](https://gykl-rr.lima.zone)


According to the german privacy-law, not everyone is allowed to view the contents of the database I used for this demo. This is why only chosen persons have access to the backend & views. Thanks for your understanding.

## Thanks
Thanks everyone for your help and support,<br>
special thanks to:
