## Demo
A demo-version of this project in its current state is available at [gykl-rr.lima.zone](https://gykl-rr.lima.zone).
According to the german privacy-law, not everyone is allowed to view the contents of the database I used for this demo. This is why only chosen persons have access to the backend & views.
