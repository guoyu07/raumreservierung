# Raumreservierung v2.1
<b>After implementing the teacher-view to the project, it's now time to test all of its functionality.
Everything done from now will be some fixes and improvements, no big changes are planned for the project from now on.</b>

## Help &amp; Support
If anyone reading this is interested in this project or is willing to help with its development, feel free to clone this repository and (stress-)test its functionalities by yourself.
If someone needs an example database for doing so, feel free to contact me.

## Demo
A demo-version of this project in its current state (v2.1) is available at [gykl-rr.lima.zone](https://gykl-rr.lima.zone)
According to the german privacy-law, not everyone is allowed to view the contents of the database I used for this demo. This is why only chosen persons have access to the backend & views. Thanks for your understanding.

## Thanks
Thanks everyone for your help and support,
special thanks to:
- Benjamin Kirchhoff
