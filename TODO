Information about Plans, Ideas and other Concepts:

Next Coming Up:
-> Main Index with Polymer CLI & Element structure ~ dynamic Imports

Next Big Plan:
-> Main Room-Reservation backend
-> Backend - Implementation

Reminders to myself:
-> Final Steps:
---> If too much time and too less hobbies: Create Clean Polymer App-Shell for Main Index & Stuff :P
---> Merge all bower_components into one main folder to save space
---> Crush / Vulcanize Polymer Views
